## Spec
Judge scores trajectory quality on both rollback and escalation paths; scores pushed to
LangFuse and stored on the incident row (`eval_score` JSONB).

**Files modified:** `src/sentinel/eval/judge.py`
- Judge agent (Haiku, **different family/model discipline** from graded agents — safety invariant) scores per-dimension (triage_accuracy, root_cause_correctness, etc.).
- `push_score(trace_id, name, value)` per dimension (§6.4); return structured `JudgeResult`.
- Evaluates reasoning quality, not outcome (§3): good escalation can score well.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase-4 orchestrator, tracing (2.4). [ ] fake LLM for deterministic tests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scores both paths; per-dimension values in [0,1]; pushed to LangFuse; stored on incident.
- [ ] Judge model distinct from the agents it grades (no self-eval).

## Tests
- **Integration (`tests/test_eval/test_judge.py`, fake LLM):** rollback + escalation trajectories both scored; scores stored; safety-reviewer confirms no self-grading.
- **Quality gate:** `--repo backend`.

## How to Verify (phase gate)
1. `pytest tests/test_eval/test_judge.py -q` green.
2. (with B7) scores appear on the LangFuse trace.
