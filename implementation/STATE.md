# Sentinel Phase 2 — Implementation State

> Live execution state. `/implement-phase` reads this first and updates it after every task.
> Planning-side state (architecture decisions) stays in [architecture/decisions.md](../architecture/decisions.md).
> Closed blockers, resolved R-items and the change log live in [history.md](history.md) — the
> build loop never reads that file. **Keep this one live-only; append history there.**

## Current Position

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Active category** | infra — **in progress** |
| **Active phase** | 6 — Dynamic Deployments & Workflows |
| **Active branch** | `dev/infra-phase-4-wiring-and-ci` |
| **Active PR** | [Sentinel-infra#8](https://github.com/Keshav0375/Sentinel-infra/pull/8) → `main` — CI green, awaiting phase gate |
| **Current task** | _phase 4 code-complete; both reviews addressed_ — PR #4 awaiting gate |
| **Tasks verified** | 22 / 72 |
| **Phases merged** | 5 / 18 |
| **Branch model** | Per repo. **infra + deployment:** `main` → `dev/<cat>-phase-<M>-<slug>` → PR back to `main` (no release branch). **backend (`Sentinel`):** `release-phase-2` → `dev/backend-phase-<M>-<slug>` → PR back to `release-phase-2`; `release-phase-2` → `main` once, at the end of Phase 2, and `main` takes nothing else. See [README §6](README.md#6-git-model--one-branch--one-pr-per-phase). |
| **Tracker commits** | straight to `main` of this repo (`sentinel-brain`) — no branch, no PR. One phase = one code PR + tracker commits here. |
| **Control plane** | `sentinel-brain` (this repo). Code repos are siblings: `../Sentinel` (backend), `../Sentinel-deployment`, `../Sentinel-infra`. |

## Next Action

**Close the infra phase-6 gate.** All 8 tasks `done-pending-review`; CI green
(Validate + Preflight + Plan, `No changes`, plan posted to the PR).

Acceptance test passed live: create → destroy → recreate `demo1`, with the vault purged and
the platform untouched.

**Owner actions:**
- ⛔ **Merge [Sentinel#18](https://github.com/Keshav0375/Sentinel/pull/18)** — `main`'s gate is 6
  checks; with #18 it is 11.
- ⚠️ **Pause and Destroy cannot be tested until PR #8 merges.** A `workflow_dispatch` workflow
  must exist on the DEFAULT branch before GitHub will dispatch it.

**Carried forward as known gaps:** `identity.tf` deleted (a declared provider is configured even
with every resource at `count = 0`, so an unauthenticable `azuread` broke every plan);
`gha-ops` cannot-delete proven by inspection only; namespaces never created, so the kubelogin
path is unexercised.

## Phase Gate Ledger

A phase moves to `verified` only after the user confirms the feature works and the PR is
merged. Newest first.

| Date | Category | Phase | Branch | PR | Verified by | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|--------|----|-----|-------|
| 2026-08-25 | infra | 5 — Dynamic Foundations | `dev/infra-phase-5-dynamic-foundations` | [#7](https://github.com/Keshav0375/Sentinel-infra/pull/7) | Keshav | Owner answered **Approve & merge**; merged `7849310`. Old estate destroyed (45 resources) and rebuilt as a two-layer platform. Proven live: a deployment workspace plans ZERO Azure resources and its `plan -destroy` reports nothing to destroy, while still reading platform outputs via `terraform_remote_state`; `gha-plan` holds `*/read` + 2 blob reads only. The merge was initially BLOCKED by the branch ruleset — the workflows still described the pre-phase-5 contract, fixed in-phase rather than deferred, which surfaced that Reader cannot refresh ACR/AKS. Superseded R5, R6, C1 and one-cluster-per-estate. |
| 2026-08-24 | infra | 4 — Cross-Repo Wiring & CI | `dev/infra-phase-4-wiring-and-ci` | [#4](https://github.com/Keshav0375/Sentinel-infra/pull/4) | Keshav | Owner answered **Approve & merge** at the gate; PR #4 merged `09b2510`→`f2aa5da`. **The identity plane was proven live**: on its first-ever CI run Terraform refreshed the whole estate under the `sentinel-gha` UAMI, exercising the OIDC round trip, R5's RBAC grant and the state blob — none of which phases 1-3 had tested, since all three applied locally as Owner. `ci_runners` built and pushed the image; the first automated `apply` succeeded. Follow-ups landed as PR #5 (ten review fixes that never reached disk, the `environment:production` credential bootstrap, and a DB start-guard) and PR #6 (workflow renames, sha- image versioning, manual dispatch). Closed B16. **Ledger row written 2026-08-25** — the sign-off happened at merge time; recording it lagged. |
| 2026-08-24 | infra | 3 — Compute & Networking | `dev/infra-phase-3-compute-modules` | [#3](https://github.com/Keshav0375/Sentinel-infra/pull/3) | Keshav | Owner ran the checklist: plan **No changes** (0 warnings), 14/14 handler tests, gate PASS (8 ran — now incl. py-unittest + ruff), AKS Stopped, bridge function registered, rotation subscription Succeeded. Both reviewers' blockers fixed on-branch (Datadog tags shape, client_payload 10-prop cap, zip redeploy, KV-literal guard, func-rg grant). Closed B12. |
| 2026-08-23 | infra | 2 — Core Resource Modules | `dev/infra-phase-2-core-modules` | [#2](https://github.com/Keshav0375/Sentinel-infra/pull/2) | Keshav | Owner ran the checklist personally: ACR Standard, Postgres AAD-only, KV RBAC + Officer/User split, empty vault by design, gate PASS (6 ran). Live tests: Entra-token psql login; KV write→read→purge. Resolved R6; both reviewers' blockers fixed on-branch. |
| 2026-08-15 | infra | 1 — Foundations & Bootstrap | `dev/infra-phase-1-foundations` | [#1](https://github.com/Keshav0375/Sentinel-infra/pull/1) | Keshav | `terraform plan` → **No changes**; both bootstrap scripts idempotent; gate PASS (5 ran); 5 federated credentials verified in Azure. Resolved R3, R4, R5, C1–C9, C12, C13. Closed B1, B2, B3, B10, B15. |

## Blockers

External dependencies that halt verification. Mirror any task-level BLOCKED here.
(Seeded from [architecture/decisions.md](../architecture/decisions.md) blockers — these gate infra Phase 1–4.)

| # | Blocker | Blocks | Owner | Status |
|---|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| B16 | ~~`sentinel-tf-identity` cannot serve infra CI — two faults~~ | — | Keshav | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-08-24.** (a) `sentinel-tf-pr` + `sentinel-tf-env-production` federated credentials created — the identity tenant now carries all three subjects the school tenant has. (b) The SP had **no directory role at all**: `transitiveMemberOf` returned empty, so B11's record that Application Administrator was granted to it was a **false positive**. Assigned via `roleManagement/directory/roleAssignments` and verified. Proven live: PR check green, both tenants authenticated **and** authorised from CI, `Plan: 0 to add, 2 to change` identical to local. |

## Open Reconciliations (decide before the affected task)

| # | Item | Affects | Status / resolution |
|---|------|---------|---------------------|

_None open._ Resolved R1–R6 are in [history.md](history.md).

## History

Closed blockers, resolved reconciliations and the full change log moved to
[history.md](history.md) on 2026-08-24 — they are audit record, not live state, and every
`/implement-phase` run was paying ~4K tokens to re-read them. Nothing in the build loop
reads history.md; append to it, never to this file.
